client:
- let Ps go back and forth between "check", calibration and test ("choose slide")
- hide mouse cursor during image slides
- display each change blindness image twice (with flicker in between) and tidy
- display warning on main page when webcam resolution isn't set to 800x600
- xlabs: "domain not licenced" bug (still present?)
- don't record data when tracking suspended
- log when tracking is suspended
- slide to show progress of data submission to server
- set timeout for server response to participant id request
- better initial text display for page
- fix fuzzy text in check slide
- better next/prev buttons for textbox
- show P own results

server:
- suppress PHP error messages on server (mucks up json!)
- clearer results text
- easier way to view old data sets
- show stats overlaid onto images (e.g. mean and CI for x and y)
- show change blindness pairs so Ps can look at them after (also link from experiment.html)

error handling:
- P accidentally exits fullscreen mode
- P starts fullscreen mode manually (not by clicking on button)
- resources don't load
- xlabs doesn't start
